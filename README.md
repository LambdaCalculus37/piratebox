# LambdaCalculus's PirateBox Project
Keeping documentation of my PirateBox project in one place while I work on it


## About This Project

I've been inspired by the current states of politics in the US, especially
with book bannings, anti-LGBTQ bills, lack of education, and lack of
resources getting into people's hands. I have wanted to build an off-grid,
easy to carry mesh networked, low powered device to various places, allow
people to hop onto its mesh network, and access books, videos, knowledge,
and be able to further share that with others.

Inspiration for this project has come from various sources, all linked
below.

1. The original Pirate Box project, sadly no longer active [but full of good ideas](https://piratebox.cc/start).
2. Hackaday's tagged "dead drop" articles, [which is what a Pirate Box is in essence](https://hackaday.com/tag/dead-drop/).
3. A SubStack post by [HydroponicTrash](https://hackers.town/@hydroponictrash@kolektiva.social) describing their own build of a Pirate Box, along with their
software stack, which is where I got some of the ideas for this project
from; their article can be read [here](https://anarchosolarpunk.substack.com/p/offgridinternet).
